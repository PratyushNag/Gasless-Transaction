You are here to have **hands-on code practice** with the **Polygon Guild Jaipur.**

## What the heck is this?

**BUIDL-IRL** is an offline workshop series for developers to learn and build on the Polygon Network. The workshop series is organized by the Polygon Guild Jaipur.

Timeline: 18th,19th,25th, 26th March and 1st April
To register for the workshops, please sign up [**HERE**](https://lu.ma/buidl-irl)

In these workshops, we will be building different dApps on the Polygon Network.

Here are the following **dApps we will be building** in this workshop series:

- [18th March] [NFT Collection dApp]
- [19th March] [NFT Staking dApp]
- [25th March] [Gasless Transactions dApp]
- [26th March] [dApp with Polygon ID]
- [1st April] [dApp on Polygon zkEVM]

## How to use this repo?

This is a monorepo containing complete guide to the dApps which we are going to build in the session. The sessions are planned in a chronological order to build a Full-Stack dApp at the end of the whole workshop series. Therefore each workshop topic is a branch in itself which will be have the required code from the previous sessions and all you have to do is to follow the README.md of that branch to BUIDL.

For Example=>
The `staking-dapp` will be preloaded with the code of NFT Staking since we will be using the same contract. All you have to do is checkout to the staking-dapp branch and then follow the code in the README.

- Open your terminal and paste the following code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{username}/BUIDL-IRL.git
cd BUIDL-IRL
```

- Open the folder in your preferred IDE.
  So, right now you are in the `main` branch, so we need to shift to first lesson `nft-collection`

- Open the same terminal and paste the following code:

```bash
git checkout nft-collection
cd backend
yarn install
```

So, now you are in the first lesson NFT collection on the **nft-collection branch**, all dependencies installed and ready to **BUIDL**.

- Follow the **Readme.md** of the each branch.

- As you complete one by one you can shift to the next branch and complete the tutorials.
